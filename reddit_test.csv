107,2018-10-06 19:09:31,Civil_GUY_2017,1,"I remember a few years ago in the playoffs when the thunder would get killed when westbrook went to the bench for a few minutes each half. The obvious question is why the thunder didnt just keep him in instead of giving him a 2 minute break each half. The thunder coaching staff said they had data that it wasnt worth it.  Then in the same playoffs James Hadden gets lambasted for disappearing in the 4th quarter during the series they lost.  I dont think harden choked or anything. He was just too tired to be the Rockets engine for 4 full quarters of playoff games (which makes getting CP3 so genious. CP3 can be the engine for a quarter and Harden the other 3).  Now, teams are limiting minutes for their players through the season. But I dont think thats the best way to prepare stars for the playoffs. If you train your star to play 33-36 minutes a game for 82 games for 6 months then you arent preparing for the 43-44 minutes a night where you get 2 days between games.  It seems like Pop has had his thumb on this for a while. He limits minutes but more than that he limits games. He would make players sit full games. And that would simulate the playiffs better.  For instance, if Inwas the lakers, I'd play lebron 31-35 planned minutes (no 4th quarters in blowouts obviously) and then after the all star break when the playoff seeding is better known,  I'd up his minutes to 44 but then sit him in back to backs and ither games that would be more than 7 in 14 days.  That way he would be ready to play 44 minutes every third day instead of 33 minutes every other day.  I hope that makes sense...so in that vein, a preseason game isnt a horrible time.to play all 48 minutes. The coach can see how his best palyers body responds to playing 48 minutes.  Now thibs knows how butler will react in the playoffs when he plays more minites and regular season overtime games when butler would get hifher minutes.","Back in 2012, Thibodeau played Jimmy Butler all 48 minutes in a preseason game against the Timberwolves",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9lw9mi/back_in_2012_thibodeau_played_jimmy_butler_all_48/,0,0.9359662459289477,0,0.998104293674867,0,0.9849338379850342,0,0.9976885096884061,0,0.9806062576464362,0,0.9959304153756197,0.08273809523809525

Edit:
Guys I am aware that 48 minutes is a lot. But the “thibs is obsessed with jimmy” thing is overplayed and it is childish. Thibs has a different coaching approach, in 2012 jimmy was the only young player he trusted. Thats why he played him way too much. In 2018 Jimmy is Thibs’ best/favourite player and he does not want him to leave the team. All I am trying to say isThibs is not a psycho in love with one of his players. He is a coach who does not trust many of his players, also Jimmy is the player he trusts the most so it is normal for him to try to recommit to the team.","Back in 2012, Thibodeau played Jimmy Butler all 48 minutes in a preseason game against the Timberwolves",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9lw9mi/back_in_2012_thibodeau_played_jimmy_butler_all_48/,0,0.9631932835426822,0,0.9976223634884924,0,0.9835119482704299,0,0.9978297900149369,0,0.9789830045900576,0,0.9920845574527564,0.155

Might as well give the guy as much playing time as possible in the preseason, when nothing matters, than in the regular season when every game matters. Plus Jimmy seems like the guy, who at the prove it stage of his career, would have been absolutely ecstatic at getting that type of opportunity.

Never mind that Jimmy was a young, late first rounder who wanted to become a fixture in a title contender's regular rotation and had previously struggled big-time in the team's previous game.

Never mind that Luol Deng who was ahead of Butler in the rotation didn't play that game and there were no other young wings on that roster the Bulls needed to evaluate or play minutes.

Or that Jimmy was known for intense conditioning during that summer where where the Tribune said he regularly went on long-many-mile runs and suicides which anyone who plays sports knows is more grueling over many days than an extra ten minutes in a single pre-season game.

Or that the Bulls had the next four days off, which was their longest break of the preseason

At that moment, it's the weaker muscles and ligaments that have to pick up the slack and they are already weak and not meant to do the full work. 

On the other hand, you can do 5 h of non stop practice since you do the same things and your body is ready for those drills. It is the opposite of always changing directions  when caught of guard(defending a player) and trying to finish with next to no space and a defender all over you.

These are the moments where after 40+mins of play, you are likely to get too tired to be aware of that and prone to be caught off guard and off balance risking your ankles and knees. 

Practices are very structured around developping good reflexes and muscle memory and are built around avoiding injuries so your point makes no sense.","Back in 2012, Thibodeau played Jimmy Butler all 48 minutes in a preseason game against the Timberwolves",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9lw9mi/back_in_2012_thibodeau_played_jimmy_butler_all_48/,0,0.9726179405964143,0,0.9972348505779685,0,0.9847051951988525,0,0.9974553873001322,0,0.9908089491329171,0,0.9962657516387632,0.096875

This ability is really valuable when it’s crunch time and the defense is locked in and it’s difficult to get separation, but his ability to do just that even against great defense makes him a lot more valuable in these difficult moments than some players who might be better overall during the season.

He really redlines his game and when watching him play you get the feeling he has an extra gear to go to when there is little space to operate.

After KD and Lebron I think he is one player who is most likely to get a good shot off regardless of the level of defense.

In no way is Kyrie a bad playoff performer by any means. But his ""clutch playoff assassin!!"" reputation is overstated and a byproduct of literally one shot. 

1) For his career in standard crunchtime settings in the playoffs [Kyrie is a 28% shooter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=Y&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=5&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&player_id=irvinky01&order_by=fg). Ive looked these stats up for many players that 28% figure is bottom level amongst stars this century. For ex CP3 scores at about 2X the rate that Kyrie does in such situations. 

2) The privilege of playing with LeBron meant that people only focused on Kyrie's good playoff moments and whenever he didn't play well it got overlooked or if they lost all the blame went to LeBron 

a) The first 2 games of the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals: Kyrie averages 20 PPG on 45% TS. Look at the history of teams down 2-0: their success rate isn't much higher than being down 3-1 we just only remember the cases when teams come back from it(like in 2016). Ie sucking the first two games of the Finals matters. 


b) First two rounds of the 2017 NBA playoffs: 50% TS. But LeBron goes HAM those two series and the Cavs sweep so nobody says anything. 


c) In game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals Kyrie was AWFUL the 2nd half. 1/7 for 3 points. The Cavs were doing all they could to have a 2015 Game 6 LAC vs HOU type collapse as a 24 point lead got cut to 8 early in the 4th. But LeBron goes king kong mode so nobody notices or cares about Kyrie. 


d) The first 4 games of the 2015 East Semis vs Chicago: Kyrie 18 PPG 36% FG. But LeBron hits a GW to prevent Cle from going down 3-1 and bails everybody out so NBD. 

For perspective: Kyrie the ""playoff assassin stats"" in playoffs: 24/5/3 57% TS. James Harden the ""playoff choker!!"": 28/7/5 57% TS while in Hou in the playoffs. Kyrie benefits from people just loving his style of play

love his game, skills are undeniable, but he's treated on this sub as some messiah of clutch because he hit one shot.

let's not forget the fact that the team he left went to the finals without him (just like the year before) and the team he went to went to the conference finals without him (just like the year before). it's great he gets numbers and looks awesome doing it, but if you don't change the outcome for your team then what do those numbers mean?

In no way is Kyrie a bad playoff performer by any means. But his ""clutch playoff assassin!!"" reputation is overstated and a byproduct of literally one shot. 

1) For his career in standard crunchtime settings in the playoffs [Kyrie is a 28% shooter](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=Y&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=5&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&player_id=irvinky01&order_by=fg). Ive looked these stats up for many players that 28% figure is bottom level amongst stars this century. For ex CP3 scores at about 2X the rate that Kyrie does in such situations. 

2) The privilege of playing with LeBron meant that people only focused on Kyrie's good playoff moments and whenever he didn't play well it got overlooked or if they lost all the blame went to LeBron 

a) The first 2 games of the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals: Kyrie averages 20 PPG on 45% TS. Look at the history of teams down 2-0: their success rate isn't much higher than being down 3-1 we just only remember the cases when teams come back from it(like in 2016). Ie sucking the first two games of the Finals matters. 


b) First two rounds of the 2017 NBA playoffs: 50% TS. But LeBron goes HAM those two series and the Cavs sweep so nobody says anything. 


c) In game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals Kyrie was AWFUL the 2nd half. 1/7 for 3 points. The Cavs were doing all they could to have a 2015 Game 6 LAC vs HOU type collapse as a 24 point lead got cut to 8 early in the 4th. But LeBron goes king kong mode so nobody notices or cares about Kyrie. 


d) The first 4 games of the 2015 East Semis vs Chicago: Kyrie 18 PPG 36% FG. But LeBron hits a GW to prevent Cle from going down 3-1 and bails everybody out so NBD. 

For perspective: Kyrie the ""playoff assassin stats"" in playoffs: 24/5/3 57% TS. James Harden the ""playoff choker!!"": 28/7/5 57% TS while in Hou in the playoffs. Kyrie benefits from people just loving his style of play

2. Playing with Lebron comes with its privileges, but this point is wrong since there were many instances especially 2 seasons ago where people kept mentioning how Kyrie performed without Lebron on the court with the argument being how the Cavs were built around Lebron. Also Kyrie kind of put that argument to bed this season with the Celtics.

a. It wasnt just Kyrie sucking in those first 2 games the whole team was bad in general, just go look at the boxscore

Lebron in comparison had a ts% of 50 in game 1 compared to Kyries 47.7%.

Game 2 I agree Kyrie played badly which shows up on the stat sheet but lets not act like it was just him perfoming badly when everyone was in a slump for those first 2 games.

b. The only one of those playoff series that this really applies to is the Raptors sweep because that really was a one man effort.

c. What is this meant to prove?  A player goes cold for 5minutes, I am pretty sure you could do this for Curry, kd and Harden.

d. Has a bad series , agree with you. 

Comparing him with Harden off of basic stats is not a good idea since you are removing context, oponnents and specific games which people find hard to forget.  

Harden is clearly the better player, however I don't think of him as a choker but looking at this years playoffs and the spurs series a few years ago I can see how people do come to that conclusion.

Bucks pushed us to 7 because they had the 2 best playoff performers in the league this year. Kris Middleton had the highest effective field goal percentage (by a whole 9% points). He shot 60% from the field and 61% from 3. Bro you realize How absolutely absurd that is? 25ppg on those percentages as a second option is Elite. 

The next highest effective field-goal percentage was his teammate Giannis who dropped  26ppg on 60% from the field. 

Those two obliterated the top rated defense in the league. They were arguably the most difficult opponent the Celtics faced. They choked away game 7 vs the Cavs. 

The Cavs weren’t top 5? You honestly think any of those lower seeded west teams would have put LeBron away? He swept the Raptors and beat the best defensive team in the league almost single handily. He wasn’t getting beat by the fuckin blazers or Jazz lmao. 


>Like honestly tho... how can you possibly think that?

Uhhh because the Celtics won 55 games while having the 3rd best winning percentage league wide vs .500 or above teams. Only the rockets and Warriors were better against legit teams. And no this didn’t drop when Irving went down, they had the same winning percentage vs .500 or above teams after he went down.

Snow was still a good defender and high IQ point guard. Big Z was an all star the year prior. And Larry Hughes was all defensive first team the year prior and had inconsistent but high potential offensive talent. Of course this is nothing like the stacked teams he would get later, but anyone would expect that team to be in the hunt for the playoffs. And I do think that Kyrie would have been able to get them there in his third year if he had a replacement level SF to replace LeBron.

Compare that to Kyrie's 3rd year now. His starting five was TT, Deng, CJ Miles, 31 year old Varejao and Dion Waiters. I know you guys love to talk about how LeBron is alway on a trash roster, but that is a true trash roster. Yet still it wasn't like these guys had 18 wins. They were five games from making the playoffs that year.

If Katrina didn’t destroy New Orleans, the Hornets/Pelicans franchise would not have played games in Oklahoma City in the interim. The NBA would never have gauged how well that city did in hosting games, and thus, it would have been a harder, if not impossible, sell for Clay Bennett to get approval from the other owners in relocating the Sonics in 2008.

And as a bonus, if Seattle still had the Sonics, there’d be no public rally cry (or boogeycity) to save the Kings from leaving Sacramento during their stadium saga. Perhaps *they’d* be the team to move to OKC once Bennett realized how hard it was to detach the Sonics from Seattle, as he sells the Sonics and buys the Kings from the now-broke Maloof brothers.",Kevin Durant wears a Shawn Kemp Sonics jersey pre-game at the Key Arena - ESPN,https://streamable.com/2tn4d,0,0.962798008072058,0,0.9958263501706806,0,0.9764946673957532,0,0.9969681307073818,0,0.9788077829110529,0,0.9940579568171825,0.004843073593073587

I don't know all the details but I can't help but think that if the Sonics had stayed in Seattle that the team would have been making enough money to pay Harden instead of trading him, thus keeping the Durant/Westbrook/Harden core together.

I realize this is all speculation but is this a theory that makes sense, or were the Sonics already losing so much money that going into the tax would have still been unfeasible?

Sonics fans believe Bennett made half-hearted efforts to keep the team there and all the proposals were never realistic to keep them. I get that. But where was the local leadership support, where where the local proposals, who was the local business leader or politician who stepped up and said let’s find a way to keep this team? I don’t blame Sonics fans, they got fucked. I don’t blame Thunder fans, they didn’t do anything.  

The Sonics moving to OKC was ultimatley about 2 things:
1: The NBA’s preferred model then and now is publicly funded arenas; allowing Bennett to buy *and move the team* to a brand new publicly funded arena was a warning to other cities. Stern knew the team would move.
   
2: Depending on your perspective: Howard Shultz or Clay Bennet. I knew the day Bennet and Co. bought the team it would end up in OKC because, well, oil billionaires who have made and lost more money then we will ever see will do whatever it takes to get what they want. That includes lying while smiling to your face.  On the other hand, couldn’t Howard Schultz see the same thing, He knew he was lying down with snakes, what did he expect to happen? He should have found a local buyer. 

I hate KD with the strength of a thousand suns, but this was appropriate and cool as hell.

Their 25+ game win streaks was amazing to watch, because it was such amazing basketball being played. I'm a basketball fan first, before I'm directly a team fan, they were amazing. I was hyped when they lost, but I was immediately looking forward to the next season to see what they were going to do, and to see part 3 and who's going up 2-1. 

Kevin Durant ruined that. He then gets there, acts like people are supposed to love him for making a team that was literally just historically hard to beat, basically impossible to beat. Then he lies all the time saying, that it's a hard decision, starts all this attitude and trash talk, the burner phone (obviously to this day still insecure, to be a keyboard Warrior defending himself), and the list goes on. Not to mention him saying this is how he really is, when it's literally never been like this since what he was in high school and college? So no, I don't want to like KD, seeing him in this jersey, was in my mind a ""stop it."" KD robbed us of what would have been two really good finals for 17-18, and actually seeing the Warriors face adversity again.

There was some local effort to keep the Sonics, it just wasn’t enough and didn’t rise to the level needed to build a new arena or anything. Ballmer tried to set up a last ditch effort to buy the team back and the city actually sued the OKC owners for breaking the lease, and managed to prove in court that the OKC owners weren’t operating in good faith (having subpoenaed the rather incriminating emails of Aubrey McClendon). However, the city settled *on the very morning that the judge was going to announce their verdict*. (The timing on this was such that Russell Westbrook was technically drafted by the SuperSonics—the relocation only became official after the draft but before the season.) It was entirely possible that the court would have compelled the team to keep playing in Seattle, which would force the OKC owners to sell the team (probably to Ballmer) and buy some more time for a new arena.

One factor was probably that Stern’s thumb was firmly on the scale. When a similar situation happened in Sacramento, Stern’s thumb was firmly on the side of the group trying to keep the team there, and he made that very clear—when he made his public statement about the Seattle bid to buy the Kings, he began his remarks by saying he had a game to attend in Oklahoma City.

A combination of the internet spoiling everything, and Fans not buying into the typical Heel tactics WWE hasn’t grown out of, makes it very difficult to create genuine heel heat which is very important for WWE’s product. It’s very difficult to get fans t truly love a baby face if they don’t truly hate the heel. And WWE has struggled bad to create good heels on their main roster.

They and the Bulls were the epitome of basketball in the 90s. They had already won a championship before, and damn close to winning a second in ‘96. They were close to another Finals run in as recent as 2005 when they went to the WCF against the Spurs, who were just absolutely shit hot and monsters on the court that year who went on to win the Finals later on. They had a very established history, home, presence, and identity with the city of Seattle and the PNW as a whole. Rivalries with the Blazers, the Rockets, the Lakers, and the Jazz gave them a name in Western Conference basketball. Legends made their careers in Seattle. Even though in the twilight of their time, the fan enthusiasm had dropped some, the Sonics were a constant within the Seattle landscape come October through April. They were and are still loved to this day. I guarantee if the NBA did the same season ticket holder drive the NHL did tomorrow, their entire arena would sell out *in minutes*. Not even hours, minutes. 

Though their emerging identity was in flux at the time of moving to OKC, had history stayed the same, you’d have the same dominating force of Durant, Westbrook, Ibaka, and Harden’s talents to use to push Seattle in to a new age of great basketball. You’d have had 3 perennial hall of famers on the team and a strong supporting cast to elevate the team to those heights, and the identity would have stayed strong throughout the whole time.

Hell, the Rams in cleveland closed for the 1943 season as literally everyone got drafted including the owner. Currently he was having the split rent with the Cleveland Indians for the stadium, and could simply not afford to because attendance was so low he was actually losing money having them play. He offered to either move to LA for a larger stadium where he got a better deal in an area without teams, or he would simply end his personal involvement with the NFL. This would leave the team in Cleveland if they could find a buyer. Nobody would even bid on the Cleveland Rams in this fledgling league. Thus the move to LA in order to save a team that was about to be closed. Do you see the big difference here? The options for the Rams in Cleveland were much different.

All that preseason means is that wins, losses, and statistics don’t carry over. If a guy played like shit or great, you have to take it for what it is. 

I was talked about DRose getting good lift under his shot again in another thread and someone commented “it’s just preseason”. What the hell does that have to do with the man’s jumper looking good?! This phrase is misused so much. lmao

Exhibition games can't and shouldn't be a predictor for how good you are/can be because of the quality of play from the players above.  But they absolutely can be a predictor for how bad you are/can be.  The reasoning is that if you can't even cut it against guys playing for nothing, then you can't be that good against guys who are actually trying.

Plus, like others have said, these terrible performances don't come in a vacuum.  He has a history of laziness and sloppy play.  The best place for him to start turning away that narrative is against guys who are not as good as him in the preseason.

Sure I'd probably value Jackson much higher, but I don't think the distinction is meaningfully different. Both have shown underwhelming promise from the standpoint of on-court production, but they are young enough so they still have some upside.
